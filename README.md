## Project Overview

The Calculator project is a software application designed to perform fundamental arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface allows users to input numerical values and select the desired operation. The application then displays the result of the operation.

## Features

- Addition: Perform addition of two or more numbers.
- Subtraction: Perform subtraction between two numbers.
- Multiplication: Multiply two or more numbers together.
- Division: Divide one number by another.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface for ease of use.
- Error Handling: The calculator handles input errors and displays appropriate error messages when necessary.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the Calculator project on your system:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository from the designated repository URL using your preferred version control tool (e.g., Git).

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Change your current working directory to the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd calculator-project
   ```


## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Launch the calculator application using the specified command.

   ```bash
   ./run_calculator
   ```

2. **Input Values**: Enter numerical values using the keyboard.

3. **Select Operation**: Use the provided buttons or commands to select the desired arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

4. **View Result**: The application will display the result of the chosen operation on the screen.

5. **Exit the Application**: When you're done using the calculator, exit the application using the provided command or close the application window.
